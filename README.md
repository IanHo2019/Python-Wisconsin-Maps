## 1000-largest-us-cities-by-population-with-geographic-coordinates
This is a dataset (in four different forms) with some information on Wisconsin cities. The data include the location of the cities and their populations. There are 20 Wisconsin cities that rank among the 1000 largest cities. We can use '1000-largest-us-cities-by-population-with-geographic-coordinates.shp' with geopandas in Python to plot maps for Wisconsin cities.

## result.csv
To plot voting patterns in the 2016 presidential election, I downloaded result data from [Wisconsin Elections Commission](https://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/results/2016/fall-general). It is a mess. I saved a cleaned up version of the file to 'results.csv'.
