# Introduction to Files

This repository has a dataset (in four different forms) with some information on Wisconsin cities. The data include the location of the cities and their populations. There are 20 cities that rank among the 1000 largest cities.

We can use '1000-largest-us-cities-by-population-with-geographic-coordinates.shp' with geopandas in Python to plot maps for Wisconsin cities.
